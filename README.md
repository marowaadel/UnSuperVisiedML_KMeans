using Elbow Method for optimal value of k in KMeans

The optimal number of clusters can be defined as follow:

1-Compute clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering) for different values of k. For instance, by varying k from 1 to 10 clusters.

2-For each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square (wss).

3-Plot the curve of wss according to the number of clusters k.

4-The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.
